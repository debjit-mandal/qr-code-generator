# QR Code Generator
A QR code generator made using Python.

The `qrcode` library must be installed by running `pip install qrcode` in the terminal or command prompt.

The `PIL` library must be installed by running `pip install pillow` in the terminal or command prompt

To run this code locally:

`git clone https://github.com/debjit-mandal/qr-code-generator`

`cd qr-code-generator`

`python main.py`

When you run the script, it will generate the QR code image with the specified properties, including error correction level and encoding mode, and display the QR code in the console.
